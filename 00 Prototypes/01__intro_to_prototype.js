In JavaScript, prototypes are the core mechanism that allows objects to inherit features from one another.

What is a Prototype?
Every JavaScript object has a hidden internal property called [[Prototype]], which refers to another object. You can access it using .prototype (for functions/constructors) or __proto__ (for objects).

This forms a prototype chain, where if a property or method isnâ€™t found on the current object, JavaScript looks for it up the chain.
