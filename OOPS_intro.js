/*

--------INTRODUCTION----------
- JavaScript is a Prototype based programming langugage.
- And it will always be.

- Although its developers have sugar coated the OOPS Concepts in JS, but internally it is still a prototype based programming language. 


- JS originally ek prototype-based language thi, aur aaj bhi under the hood, wahi hai. Baad mein unhone Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) jaisi features jaise class, constructor, inheritance ko syntactic sugar ke form mein add kiya taaki OOP developers ko familiar lage.





------- REAL NATURE OF JS---------
Prototype-based programming: Har object dusre object se inherit karta hai, jise prototype kehte hain.

JS mein object inheritance hota hai through prototype chaining, na ki classical class-based inheritance jaise Java, C++ mein hota hai.






--------THEN OOPS FEATURES ADDED-------------
    Baad mein OOPS features aaye:
class, constructor, extends — yeh sab JS mein ES6 (2015) ke baad aaye.

But yeh sirf syntactic sugar hai — internally JS still uses prototype chaining.






----------CONCLUSION---------------
- JavaScript ek prototype-based language hai, OOPS ke concepts later add kiye gaye for developer familiarity. But under the hood, sab kuch still prototypes par based hai.
- JS is prototype, was prototype and will remain prototype based language.
